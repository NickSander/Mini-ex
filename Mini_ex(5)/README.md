This work is called "The Haiku Generator" [Check it out here](https://rawgit.com/NickSander/Mini_ex/gh-pages/Mini_ex(4)/index.html)

My program, is a super basic japanese styled haiku generator.
By the press of a button, the program utilizes the RiTa.js library and a .json file, to generate a Haiku poem.
The RiTa library supports the creation of a new 'grammar' system and the json contains the grammar rules.
When you press the button the rita library get the 'rules' and dictionary from the json file and the result is created in the sketch.

As mentioned, I've used the RiGrammer function from RiTa to create a probabilistic context-free grammar with literary extensions for text-generation.
I then load the json file for the new RiGrammer() to read.

This exercise was a pain in the butt to make. When working with RiTa i often felt completely lackluster in my coding knowledge since it
indroduces so many new aspects to coding. Therefore, this exercise required A LOT of researching and even more debugging and troubleshooting.
Sadly it also made the exercise kind of stressful to make since, i had so many great ideas, but my software always fell short because of
my lack in knowledge on multiple areas. json, yaml, p5dom lib etc. 

I had great ideas for making a really cool piece of software with everything japanese themed and authentic looking, but small errors i couldn't
figure out how to debug made me eventually realise it was over my head, and instead make this simple generator.
It was a great base for learning more about Data formatting languages like json and yaml and other aspects of the p5 and RiTa lib.
