This work is called "last-Minute-Throw-Together-To-Explore-Feedback-With-A-Hint-Of-for-loop"

So, this work i'm really not particularly proud of.
I spent most of the week working on another program, which was supposed to be a site playing music while showcasing a sound visualization
in the form of an artistic radial graph of the sound amplitude. But for some frustrating reason i couldn't get the sound implementation to
work properly, even after consulting several other people. And in the end, I had to give up, due to time constraint. sigh.

Therefore, this program right here, is a last min code i threw together to have an assignment ready.
So the mini_ex revolved around making a program with a notion of feedback and loop. Therefore I made a graphical construction of ellipses
which sizes are controlled with the mouse movement along the X axis. furthermore, the background changes rgb colors when the mouse is moved
around on the canvas. The ellipse colors are random.

To explore the loop concept, i drew the ellipses using the for loop function. This function simplifies the creation of several shapes, in this case ellipses.
the loop continues to draw according to the given parameters. in this case, the ellipses are drawn along the x axis with a 100 pixel gap until they reach the canvasWidth.
i couldn't figure out how to also make a for loop for the ellipses to be drawn along the y axis, so i had to manually make several for loops for the Y placement.

It contains the conecpt of feedback in the shape of the ellipse sizes and background color you can control with the mouse cursor, and the concept of loop in the use of for loop function.
