For this mini_ex i made Pong!
I used the Coding Train video on Pong by Daniel Shiffman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrC5Qcb2G4 as reference.
Since Dans pong code is written in Processing (java) i had to first convert it to javascript(p5js), in this process i altered some syntaxs(plural?) and changed the GUI to look more like the OG Pong game. (scores, mid-vertical line, paddles and paddle speed).

To make the program my own, i furher implemented a soundtrack and varies sounds to enhance the gameplay-experience. Pong is such a solid game, but in my opinion it lacks excitement after 1 min. of play. That's why I implemented an EPIC soundtrack to enhance the competetive feelign. I furthermore added an FFT feature to analyse the sound output and visualize it as the vertical line seperating the player-halves.

I realized some people might find the soundtrack obstructive, so i decided to implement a slider to control the background music and thereby also the "vividness" of the FFT wave. I did try to implement a slider for controlling the paddle sizes and thereby increasing/decreasing the difficulty, but enourmous ammounts of variable errors put a stopper to my efforts. I belive the issue was because of the paddle being defined as a seperate object.

The difficulty with this weeks mini_ex was "copying" another persons code. It's not always easy to understand what somebody else have written in code and then having to convert it to another coding langauge. I could have choosen another p5js coding challenge video, but when i saw pong, i had to try and recreate it. Im really happy with the outcome. the program is almost bugless as far as i know, and runs excellent!

Flowcharts can help with communicating your program features to another person. It simplefies the aspects of the matter, and thereby making it more understandable whilst getting a better overview, not only for other peoples ease, but also for your own.
The flowchart can also be used to map the program before you start the actual coding progress for a more navigated process.

finally, ["PONG!"](https://rawgit.com/NickSander/Mini_ex/gh-pages/Mini_ex(8)/index.html)
