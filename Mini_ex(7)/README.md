["The Serenade of Mark Hanna"](https://rawgit.com/NickSander/Mini_ex/gh-pages/Mini_ex(7)/index.html)

My form art is a crossover between the p5.dom and the p5.sound library.
I used the p5.Amplitude function to get the amplitude levels of a mp3 file, I then mapped those to value of the p5.dom sliders. I drew them in a for loop, i rotated them and i made them bigger, so they resemble a sound wave. simple, yet aestheticly beatiful.
