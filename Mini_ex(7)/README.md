My form art is a crossover between the p5.dom and the p5.sound library.
I used the p5.Amplitude function to get the amplitude levels of a mp3 file, I then mapped those to value of the p5.dom sliders. I drew them in a for loop, i rotated them and i made them bigger, so they resemble a sound wave. simple, yet aestheticly beatiful.

In my limited experience objects often seems like a good way to make a code easier for you and your piers to organise/read. It helps structure the code, and makes for easy access etc. I do sometimes feel, that objects have a tendensy to overcomplicates situaitions, and have the oppesite effect of its original intend. It can actually be harder to read and understand. Objects also seem very easy to reuse and implement into other codes/programes. I don't think i have enough practical knowledge on programming with objects, to really say what limitations objects may have, but after some research and reading, it seems like their are some obvious limitations or inconveniences with objects, for instance, it seems that objects require a great planning phase and a huge amount of coding time, which i can absolutely, acknowledge to be a problem, but as your code/program gets longer and heavier, object oriented programming becomes very useful for organised work. In generel, it seems like their is a lot of positives with oob in these times.
