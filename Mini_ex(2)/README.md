We got asked to make a piece of software, in where we expressed an example of a glitch/bug/noise.
Since I'm relatively new to the coding game, I spent a lot of time on p5js' website trying to learn all the different references and actually trying them out for myself. I came across this curveVertex and curveTightness feature which I kind of understand and at the same time kind of dont understand. Therefore I decided to play around with it, and i thought it looked so crazy and kind of glitch-like that I decided to implement it in my software. I tried to create the shape of an arrow, but when you move the mouse curser, the curveTightness changes and the arrow deforms, making it look like the software is having some kind of glitch. Coding the arrow was kind of difficult as the curveVertex function is hard for me to understand, but that's also the reason i decided to play around with it. In my adventures in the pj5s references library trying to learn randomising, i came across the neat feature called noise. Noise is a branch of randomising made by some smart dude back in the 80's. If you implement the noise function on a vertical line so it moves "randomly" back and forth on the canvas, it looks like the software is recieving some kind of noise, and i thought it looked cool therefore i also implemented that into my software. The coding in my mini_ex is simple to understand and it dosn't require tons of syntax's and coding, but i still had lots of fun playing around with it, especially the noise and random function, which's possibilities i'm very fascinated by.

Errors are essentially imperfections or mistakes made by the creators of the given object - in our context it would be errors in coding software or hardware. Errors are hard to avoid and even though most creators of hardware and software strive for an errorless piece of software, its often hard to avoid as users start to really use the software. Since our daily lives consists of so much different software and hardware errors are an essential part of this technical era, and many artists etc. are seeing the aesthetics of errors, glitches and bugs and uses them to express themselves. In this situation errors aren't mistakes anymore but features.
