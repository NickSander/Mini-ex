OOPS: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO 'ALLOW' THE API SCRIPT TO WORK WHEN YOU LAUNCH THE PROGRAM. SINCE THE SOFTWARE USES AN API FROM AN "UNKNOWN SOURCE"
MOST BROWSERS AUTOBLOCK THE SCRIPTS TO WORK.
YOU MANUALLY HAVE TO ALLOW THE SCRIPT TO WORK BY PRESSING THE SECURITY FUNCTION BESIDES THE URL BAR (LEFT SIDE ON FIREFOX. RIGHT SIDE ON CHROME)

I promise, it's not a hacker script..
Sorry for the inconvenience

Pictures on how to allow the software to retrieve the api data from Apixu.com
