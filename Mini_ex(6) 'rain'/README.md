My two pieces are called 'Weather.Generated.Art' (original, i know)
While programming this mini_ex i created these two versions of my generated art. I decided to upload both, as they may seem similair,
but their aesthetic expression was so different, and i really liked them both.

My pieces are being drawn by the power of the weather. The softwares utilizes an api from Apixu.com, which sends the current weather conditions
from somewhere around the world (in this case Aarhus) to the program. The program then utilizes the retrieved data like wind_direction
to draw on the canvas. It uses the wind direction to decide by which angle the piece should be drawn.
The software also recieves temp, wind speed, wind direction and current weather conditions, which are printed as html element under the canvas.

Originally, I inteded for the program also to draw with temperature (if the weather is hot, the canvas would be drawn in red nuances, and if cold in blu nuances),
windspeed (the faster the wind speeds, the faster the software would draw). But time became a factor when i ran into issues with converting the api data
from the json to visable elements in the program. This piece have been super exciting and informative to work with and i'm definitely going to proceed with this project
and implement even more api data and functions.

since i didn't get the windspeed and temperature data implemented into the outcome of the drawing, I didnt reach the requirements for 3 rules.
I also wanted to make the program autoupdate so when the weather shiftet, it would immediately have an effect on the drawing, but i couldn't figure out
a good way to implement that 'live' feature.
Currently the color of the ellipses are randomised blue nuances and the speed by which they travel are fixed. in case of the 'raindrops', they are
programmed to drop randomly inside a certain area. When the ellipses reach the border of the canvas, they 'continue' from the oher side of the canvas.

I do though think though, I thouched on a super interesting subject, in art being generated by the weather conditions, completely out of human control, and having a 'live' aspect.


OOPS: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO 'ALLOW' THE API SCRIPT TO WORK WHEN YOU LAUNCH THE PROGRAM. SINCE THE SOFTWARE USES AN API FROM AN "UNKNOWN SOURCE"
MOST BROWSERS AUTOBLOCK THE SCRIPTS TO WORK.
YOU MANUALLY HAVE TO ALLOW THE SCRIPT TO WORK BY PRESSING THE SECURITY FUNCTION BESIDES THE URL BAR (LEFT SIDE ON FIREFOX. RIGHT SIDE ON CHROME)

I promise, it's not a hacker script..
Sorry for the inconvenience
