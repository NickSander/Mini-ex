In my throbber design, i pulled some inspiration from the Google Chrome logo. After i got the hang of the throbber syntax and
started going more in-depth in the possibilities of my throbber code, i tested the possibilities of creating separate ellipses so i
could give them individual properties i.e. colors. When the colors got implemented i immediately saw the recemblence to the chrome logo,
and i decided to make that. So that's what i did!

The procces, working with the throbber code, was extremely fun and fruitful and several mini project with my co-students, emerged from
working with the throbber throughout the week. We made several different throbbers and even used the rotationg syntax to create a small-
time 'simulation' of the solar systems orbit around the sun. 
(Here's an example of the solar system. [Program Weblink](https://rawgit.com/NickSander/Mini_ex/gh-pages/Mini_ex(3)/solar%20system/index.html)
note: The code is written in cooperation with my co-student Magnus(https://github.com/MagnusJMJ)
but he did most of the coding)
